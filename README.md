# Fairness-Driven AI: Mitigating Bias in Machine Learning
Overview

This project implements comprehensive bias detection and mitigation techniques for machine learning models deployed in critical sectors including healthcare, finance, education, and criminal justice. We address four major types of bias: selection bias, label bias, algorithmic bias, and representation bias.
The research demonstrates six effective mitigation strategies: Balanced Data Sampling (SMOTE), Consensus-Based Labeling, Fairness Constraints in Model Training, Adversarial Debiasing, Threshold Adjustment for Subgroups, and Continuous Model Retraining. Our experiments show significant improvements in fairness metrics, with accuracy gains ranging from 19% to 36% across different techniques while maintaining model performance.
